							<p>Born and raised in the mountains of Colorado, I came to appreciate the beauty found in the mountains that surrounded me
							and developed a sense of adventure and curiosity from a young age. That curiosity grew as I traveled to many places with my parents. These experiences instilled in me
							me a fresh perspective of what surrounded me and a desire to learn about the new places, peoples, cultures, and landscapes I encountered. While deciding on a major
							for my undergraduate degree, I attended a study abroad to Tanzania with the Geography Department. That experience enriched my perspective and increased my desire
							to learn even more. Upon returning home, I declared Geography as a major and have never looked back since. I had a goal to find something 
							that I enjoyed doing to pursue for a career. With GIS, I achieved that goal. I love what I do from getting to create and design
							maps on many different topics to visualizing and solving problems from a spatial perspective. I feel that I continue to learn something

							Additionally, I strive to keep learning and expanding my skills to help accomplish my goal. As such, I am currently pursuing
